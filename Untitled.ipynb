I know that black hole that seems to consume you but a time will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.   Domestic terrorism is a stain on the soul of our nation and a threat to our democracy — we need to confront its rise head-on. That’s why my Administration is releasing the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.       Yesterday I had the chance to visit the 9/11 memorial at NATO Headquarters. It s a solemn reminder of that awful day and the thousands of Americans we lost. In that moment of peril our Allies were there for us — and we must always be there for them.  On this ninth anniversary of DACA Dreamers deserve lasting stability in the only home they have ever known.

As the First Lady says: Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us. That’s why we’re working to pass the American Families Plan which makes historic investments in education. Secretary Cardona sat down with teachers to discuss how it’ll help them.  Today’s news shows that folks are feeling better about the economy. And for good reason: growth is near a 40-year high unemployment is at its lowest level since the pandemic and wages are on the rise.\\n\\nOur economic plan is working — and we’re just getting started.  President Macron and I stand together ready to take on the toughest challenges we face.  Diplomacy is back.  Yesterday I announced that the U.S. will donate half a billion additional Pfizer vaccines to help countries in dire need in this pandemic. In this moment — our values call us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against COVID-19.  It’s the first official day of the G7 Summit here in the United Kingdom. I’m looking forward to reinforcing our commitment to multilateralism and working with our allies and partners to build a more fair and inclusive global economy.\\n \\nLet’s get to work.   Our service members are the solid steel spine of America.  Over the next few days I’ll be participating in meetings with many of our closest partners. This diplomacy is essential — because no single nation acting alone can meet the challenges we face today or build the shared future we all seek.  The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is stronger than ever. Thank you for hosting me today Prime Minister Johnson.  It’s the right thing to do — and the smart thing to do. These vaccines will save millions of lives.  We won’t be safe from COVID-19 at home until we defeat it in every corner of the globe. That’s why we’re donating half a billion vaccine doses to countries that need it most.  The United States is back. Democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges — and the issues that matter most to our future.  Today I’m announcing that the United States will donate half a billion new Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries. \\n\\nThese Pfizer vaccines will save millions of lives around the world and be produced through the power of American manufacturing.   Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 vaccination program and the effort to defeat COVID-19 around the world.  On my first foreign trip we’re going to make it clear — the United States and the democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the challenges of our new age.  I believe we are at an inflection point in history. A moment where it falls to us to prove that democracies will not just endure — they will excel as we rise to seize the enormous opportunities of this new age.  To the members of the United States Armed Forces I had the honor of meeting at Royal Air Force Mildenhall: thank you. You are the best of our country — and the First Lady and I are so proud.  Today I’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the G7 Summit in Cornwall. I look forward to affirming the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom and discussing how we’ll tackle our shared challenges together in the years ahead.   Hello United Kingdom!  Diplomacy is essential – because no single nation acting alone can meet the challenges we face today or build the shared future we all seek. \\n \\nTo tackle this century’s most pressing challenges we have to work together.   Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. \\n \\nWe have to defend it. \\nStrengthen it. \\nRenew it. \\n \\nAnd I know that the American people are up to this job.   America is better positioned to advance our national security and our economic prosperity when we bring together like-minded nations to stand with us.\\n \\nOur unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships are a key American advantage.   Less than 1% of Americans make the choice to serve our nation in uniform.\\n \\nThe rest of us — the other 99 percent of us — we owe them.   Tune in as the First Lady and I deliver remarks to US Air Force personnel and their families stationed at Royal Air Force Mildenhall.  Since we took office the unemployment rate has fallen and vaccination rates have soared.\\n\\nThat’s the American Rescue Plan at work.   I’m on my way to the U.K. and Europe today for the first foreign trip of my presidency. I know that democracies can rally together to meet the challenges of this new age – this week in Europe we have the chance to prove that.   Folks Wall Street didn’t build this country — the great middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class.   I’m honored every day to serve as president.  When we took office the economy was in crisis. We got right to work delivering much-needed economic relief — and as a result more than 40% fewer families struggled to pay for necessities like food rent and utilities this spring.\\n\\nThat’s the American Rescue Plan at work.   Folks the Delta variant — a highly infectious COVID-19 strain — is spreading rapidly among young people between 12 and 20 years old in the U.K. If you’re young and haven’t gotten your shot yet it really is time. It’s the best way to protect yourself and those you love.   Tomorrow I depart for Europe on the first foreign travel of my presidency. The trip is about realizing America’s renewed commitment to our allies and demonstrating that democracies can both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age.  I’m working hard to find common ground with Republicans when it comes to the American Jobs Plan but I refuse to raise taxes on Americans making under $400 000 a year to pay for it.\\n\\nIt’s long past time the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.   To transgender Americans across the country — especially the young people who are so brave — I want you to know your President has your back.\\n\\nDuring Pride Month — and all the time.   With the American Jobs Plan we’re going to make historic investments in American manufacturing to ensure the future is made right here in America.  We’ve made incredible progress in the fight against COVID-19 but we need everyone across the country to pull together to get us over the finish line. Get vaccinated — and encourage your friends and family to get protected as well.\\n\\nWe can do this.   The U.S. is the only major economy where projections of future growth are stronger today than they were before the pandemic hit in 2020.\\n\\nAmerica is on the move again — and we can’t stop now.   We’re growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out. Because it’s long past time every American has a fair shot to get ahead.   We’re getting America back on track.  I met with survivors of the Tulsa Massacre this week to help fill the silence. Because in silence wounds deepen. And as painful as it is only in remembrance do wounds heal.  Congratulations to the Class of 2021. You’re graduating at an inflection point in our nation’s history – and you have a genuine opportunity to change the trajectory of our country. Seize this moment. I can’t wait to see what you accomplish.  In our first four months we’ve created more jobs than any administration in American history.\\n\\nAnd we’re just getting started.   Great news folks: we hit record-high health care enrollment. 31 million people now have coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Couldn’t think of a better person to celebrate this milestone with than President Obama so I gave him a call.  On the 40th year of the HIV/AIDS epidemic we remember the lives cut short by this terrible disease and celebrate the resilience and dignity of those living with HIV. Let’s continue to eradicate the stigma faced by too many – and work to end this epidemic once and for all.   The long-term unemployment rate has declined the most since 2011 — that’s the American Rescue Plan at work for American families and the American economy.  This Gun Violence Awareness Day I’m wearing orange in honor of the Americans killed every day by gun violence and the survivors and families living with the consequences. It’s a public health epidemic — and it’s time we end it. I urge Congress to take action to save lives.  Vaccinations are up.\\nJobs are up.\\nGrowth is up.\\nPeople gaining health care coverage is up.\\nSmall business confidence is up.\\n \\nAmerica is on the move again.       In my first four months in office more than two million jobs have been created. \\n\\nThat s more than double the rate of my predecessor and more than eight times the rate of President Reagan.  Tune in as I deliver remarks on the May jobs report.  Today’s jobs report shows historic progress for American families and the American economy. We added 559 000 jobs in May created a record two million jobs in our first four months and unemployment is at its lowest level since the pandemic started.\\n\\nAmerica is on the move again.   This progress didn’t just happen by chance. We got to this moment because we took aggressive action from day one — with a whole-of-government response.  Unemployment claims are down 50% and 64% of adults are vaccinated since I took office. That’s progress.  We have a chance with the investments I’m proposing to increase the size of our economy by $4.5 trillion over the next decade and win the competition for the future.   The American Jobs Plan will rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure and help tackle the climate crisis head-on. Watch as Ali Zaidi White House Deputy National Climate Advisor explains more in 15 seconds or less.  Americans can do anything if we do it together. So do your part. Give it your all through July 4th — let’s get as many folks vaccinated as possible.  Because of our vaccination program and our economic response — America is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year’s. \\n \\nA summer of freedom.\\nA summer of joy. \\nA summer of get-togethers and celebrations.   America is — and always will be — a nation of immigrants. Our diversity makes us stronger. This National Immigrant Heritage Month let’s reaffirm and draw strength from that enduring identity and celebrate the history and achievements of immigrant communities around the country.   Today we announced a month-long effort to pull out all the stops to free ourselves from this virus — and get as many Americans vaccinated as possible by July 4. Find a vaccine near you at  Exercise your freedom to live without fear. Get vaccinated.   Today we are announcing a month-long effort to get 70% of adult Americans vaccinated. It will take everyone doing their part so we can declare our independence from COVID-19 and free ourselves from the grip it has held over our lives.   In just over four months thanks to the American people we have made incredible progress getting people vaccinated.\\n\\nNearly 170 million Americans — of every party every background every walk of life — have stepped up and rolled up their sleeves to get a shot.   Tune in as I give an update on our COVID-19 response and the vaccination program.  We know from history that bold investments can raise both the floor and the ceiling of the economy for all of us — it’s why I’ve proposed generational investments like the American Jobs Plan. \\n \\nIt’s what we need today to succeed tomorrow.   We’re witnessing an all-out assault on our democracy — and we need to act swiftly to protect the sacred right to vote.\\n\\nWe need the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know — and not what we should know.\\n\\nWe memorialize what happened in Tulsa 100 years ago so it can’t be erased.   Tune in as I deliver remarks to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre.  Pride stands for courage it stands for justice and most of all it stands for love. As we recall the trials the LGBTQ+ community has endured and celebrate the trailblazers who’ve bravely fought for equality let us recommit to the work that remains. Happy Pride Month!   We can’t build back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our nation for far too long. That’s why today we’re taking additional steps to advance racial equity narrow the racial wealth gap and build Black wealth.  100 years ago the thriving Black community of Greenwood in Tulsa Oklahoma was ruthlessly attacked by a white supremacist mob—as many as 300 Black Americans were killed and 10 000 were left homeless. Today I’m visiting the Greenwood Cultural Center and meeting with survivors.   Each year Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made.  On Memorial Day we honor and reflect upon the courage integrity and selfless dedication of the members of our Armed Forces who have made the greatest sacrifice in service to our nation.  We have a sacred obligation as a nation to always honor the memory of those we’ve lost — and to support their families.\\n\\nThat is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day.   Tune in as we honor our fallen heroes at the 153rd National Memorial Day Observance.  Army Colonel Ralph Puckett is an American hero.  Tune in as I deliver remarks at a Memorial Day service.  Stay cool this weekend folks.  We’re going to see enormous change and innovation in the next ten years and we need to capitalize on it with the American Jobs Plan.  Midshipman Barber represents the best of this nation — brave selfless and dedicated to service. Vice President Harris sat down to hear her story for this week’s conversation.  Before I took office independent experts were projecting that the economy would grow at 3 or 4% this year. \\n\\nThey are now projecting growth of well above 6% — the fastest growth in this country in nearly 40 years.  I sat down with Brave Wilderness Jackie Aina and Manny Mua to talk about why Americans 12 and older should get vaccinated against COVID-19.\\n\\nWatch the full YouTube Town Hall here:  Our service members are the absolute best of America. \\n\\nOur heart.\\nOur honor.\\nOur solid steel spine. \\n \\nMy message to all who serve is simple: thank you.   Tune in as I deliver remarks from Joint Base Langley-Eustis.  Today I released my budget for the upcoming fiscal year. It builds on the progress we’ve made over the last few months and makes historic investments that will help our nation build back better for decades to come. Read more here:  I was honored to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea last week at the White House. The alliance between our nations was forged on the battlefield over 70 years ago. Last week we recommitted ourselves to this ironclad alliance.  Tune in as I deliver remarks with Governor Northam on Virginia’s progress in the fight against COVID-19.  We still have work to do but our future today is as bright and as wide open as it has ever been. This is our moment to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and middle out – and win the competition for the future.  Thanks to the American Rescue Plan millions of rescue payments of up to $1 400 have gone out helping families pay the rent cover the bills buy groceries. Those checks mattered.  Before I took office average initial claims for unemployment insurance were over 830 000 – and this week we learned that those claims have fallen below 460 000 – down by almost half and at the lowest level we’ve seen since the pandemic struck.  Before I took office – almost 24 million Americans were going hungry. That number has already dropped by 25%.  My Administration has created about 1.5 million jobs in our first three months in office – that’s more jobs than have ever been created in the first three months of any presidency in history.  I said from the very beginning: there’s no chance to bring the economy back unless we beat the pandemic. I made the vaccine program a priority – and now 50% of American adults and about 75% of seniors are fully vaccinated. We can’t let up now.  America is on the move again. We’ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-century pandemic and a once-in-a-generation economic crisis.  I believe this is our moment to rebuild our economy from the bottom up and the middle out.  We have a choice to make. We can keep giving every break in the world to corporations and CEOs. Or we can ask them to pay their fair share and use that money to make two years of community college free for every student in America.\\n\\nI know what I choose.  We have created more jobs in our first three months in office than have ever been created in the first three months of any presidency — about 1.5 million new jobs.   This is our moment to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.   The bottom line is this: The Biden economic plan is working. We’ve had record job creation. We’re seeing record economic growth.\\n \\nWe’re creating a new paradigm.   50% of American adults are now fully vaccinated.\\nOur economy has added about 1.5 million jobs.\\nUnemployment claims are down by more than a third — the lowest since the pandemic started.\\n \\nAmerica is on the move again.   We’ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-generation economic crisis. \\n\\nAnd now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow?   Tune in as I deliver remarks on our economic progress and share my vision for the future.  In March of 2020 I went to Cleveland for a campaign event — but our rally was cancelled due to growing concerns about COVID-19. A long dark year lay ahead. \\n \\nToday America is on the move again and I’m headed back to talk about our progress. \\n \\nSee you soon Ohio!   We are still awaiting many of the details of this latest mass shooting in San Jose but there are some things we know for sure. There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. Every life taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. \\n \\nWe must do more.   Shortly after taking office I instructed our Intelligence Agencies to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 virus. Today I’ve asked the Intelligence Community to redouble those efforts and send me a report in 90 days.\\n\\n  We can tackle the climate crisis head-on with a new Civilian Climate Corps. The American Jobs Plan will invest $10 billion to put Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters bolstering community resilience and advancing environmental justice.   The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It’ll invest in American workers and create millions of good-paying union jobs – 90% of which do not require a college degree.   It’s never been a good idea to bet against the American people.\\n \\nAmerica is coming back.        Congratulations to Kristen Clarke on making history — there’s no one better to lead the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division. I know she’ll work tirelessly to advance civil rights and push our nation closer to our founding ideals of liberty justice and equality for all.  As of today 50% of American adults are fully vaccinated.\\n\\nThat’s a big deal folks.   Earlier today in the Oval Office I met with George Floyd’s family. They’ve shown extraordinary courage over the last year especially his young daughter Gianna who I met again today. The day before her father’s funeral she told me “Daddy changed the world.”\\n \\nHe has.  No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones. The American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.   It’s time we invest in the future of America again. The American Jobs Plan will rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges ensure every American has access to clean drinking water and bring high-speed internet to every community.\\n \\nLet’s get it done.   It’s been one year since George Floyd was murdered. In that time George’s family has shown extraordinary courage. Last month’s conviction was a step towards justice – but we cannot stop there. \\n\\nWe face an inflection point. We have to act.   That’s progress.  Today I signed the Alaska Tourism Restoration Act into law. Tourism is vital to the state of Alaska — and this law will help revitalize the industry and support Alaskans by allowing large cruise ships to return to the state this summer.  It’s incredibly important that young people get the COVID-19 vaccine — not only to protect themselves but also their families neighbors and communities.\\n \\nWatch our full YouTube Town Hall on Vaccines here:  Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is easier than ever. Text your zip code to 438829 to find a location near you — and go get vaccinated today.   I know folks have a lot of questions about the COVID-19 vaccines so Dr. Fauci and I hosted a YouTube Town Hall with Manny Mua Brave Wilderness and Jackie Aina to answer them. Make sure to tune in for the premiere:  I have asked Secretary Blinken to travel to the Middle East to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and other key partners. He will discuss our continued commitment to Israel’s security and the coordinated effort to ensure assistance reaches Gaza.  The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable and they must stop. I condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad — it’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.   Dr. Walensky sat down to answer your questions on the COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy fertility and more. Watch here:  Since we took office hunger rates have dropped 43% among adults. They’re at their lowest rates since the start of the pandemic.\\n\\nThat’s the American Rescue Plan at work.   Let’s finish strong folks. We’ve got to fight this virus until the end.  Today my Administration announced a new 18 month designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti. \\n\\nRead more:  This week I signed an Executive Order to address the threat climate change poses to our economy. The Order will help mitigate climate-related financial risk spur the creation of good-paying jobs and help position the U.S. to lead the global economy. \\n\\n  Since we took office we’ve gone from an economy in crisis to one that is projected to grow faster than it has in nearly 40 years. \\n\\nThat’s progress. Let’s keep it going.   The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure create millions of good-paying jobs and win the future. Watch as Secretary Buttigieg breaks the plan down:  I was honored to host H.E. Moon Jae-in President of the Republic of Korea. The alliance between our two nations is stronger than ever and the linchpin of peace security and prosperity for Northeast Asia the Indo-Pacific and the world.  H.E. Moon Jae-in President of the Republic of Korea and I just finished our bilateral meeting at the White House. Tune in for our joint press conference.  The truth is we have no time to waste when it comes to the threat of climate change.\\n\\nWe need to act. We need the American Jobs Plan.   Before we took office the economy was creating an average of just 60 000 jobs a month.\\n\\nNow we’re creating an average of over 500 000 jobs every month.\\n\\nWe’re building back better every day.   Tune in as I award the Medal of Honor to Army Colonel Ralph Puckett.  This afternoon I’m hosting H.E. Moon Jae-in President of the Republic of Korea at the White House for a bilateral meeting. I look forward to renewing the ironclad alliance between our two nations while working side-by-side to tackle our shared challenges.   I believe that Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live in safety and security and to enjoy equal measures of freedom prosperity and democracy. \\n\\nMy Administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy toward that end.  These hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many civilians including children. I send my sincere condolences to all the families Israeli and Palestinian of those who lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded.   Prime Minister Netanyahu informed me that Israel has agreed to a mutual unconditional ceasefire. The Egyptians have now informed us that Hamas and the other groups in Gaza have also agreed.   Tune in as I deliver remarks on the Middle East.  Incidents of hate against Asian Americans have seen a shocking spike over the last year. It’s wrong — and it’s un-American.\\n \\nTo all those who are hurting: we see you and we are committed to stopping the hatred and bias.   Tune in as I sign the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.  With the hard work and ingenuity of the American people there’s not a single thing we cannot accomplish.  To everyone struggling with mental health I want you to know you are not alone. On this Mental Health Action Day my Administration is committed to eliminating barriers and ensuring everyone has the support they need to heal recover and thrive.   Hate has no place in America – and I look forward to making that clear this afternoon by signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.   I was honored to speak at the Coast Guard Academy’s Commencement today. To the class of 2021: congratulations. May God protect you all as you set out on your journeys and may God protect all those who wear the uniform of the United States of America.  Community college should be free.\\n\\nThe American Families Plan will finally make that a reality for millions of Americans.   Mark my words: The future will be made in America.   Get vaccinated.   Tune in as I address the graduating cadets at the United States Coast Guard Academy’s 140th Commencement.  When we took office four months ago the economy was in crisis. We knew there was no time to waste so we got right to work.\\n\\nNow we’re creating an average of 500 000 jobs a month and building an economy that works for all — not just those at the top.\\n \\nThat’s progress.   Get in folks we’re going to win the competition for the 21st century.  Being at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center today brought me home. For more than thirty years my Dad managed car dealerships in Delaware. He would’ve loved visiting this complex where you feel the history and see the future of an iconic American industry.  As a former public defender I’ve seen how timely and affordable access to the legal system can make all the difference. But low-income people have long struggled to secure quality access. That’s why today I took action to expand access to legal representation and the courts.   Here’s the deal: trickle-down economics has never worked.\\n\\nIt’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.   When I think of the climate crisis I think of jobs.\\n\\nIf we act to save the planet we can create millions of jobs generate significant economic growth and raise the standard of living of people around the world.   The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It’s a plan that will leave no one behind. That’s why nearly 90% of the jobs created in the plan do not require a bachelor’s degree.   The previous Administration had infrastructure week every week for four years but did nothing to get the job done.\\n\\nFolks the rest of the world is moving fast ahead and we’ve got to step up.   Join me as I give remarks on the American Jobs Plan.  I’m on my way to Dearborn to tour the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center. See you soon Michigan!   In March I signed the American Rescue Plan into law — giving 90% of families with children a tax cut.\\n\\nWe’re making our tax system work for the middle class.  If you’re a firefighter or a teacher you’re paying a higher tax rate than most of corporate America. It’s unacceptable. I’m sick and tired of corporations not paying their fair share.\\n\\nWe’re going to change that.   With 90% of Americans living within five miles of a vaccination center it’s never been easier to get your COVID-19 shot. Head to today to find a location near you.\\n\\nGet vaccinated folks.   For working families with children this tax cut sends a clear message: help is here.  On this International Day Against Homophobia Transphobia and Biphobia the message from the United States is clear: everyone deserves dignity and equality no matter who they are or whom they love. We’re committed to advancing LGBTQ+ rights here at home and around the world.   America will never be fully safe while this pandemic is raging globally. That’s why today I’m announcing that over the next six weeks we will send 80 million vaccine doses overseas.\\n \\nIt is the right thing to do. It is the smart thing to do. It is the strong thing to do.   When tomorrow’s vaccination numbers come out they will show that 60% of American adults have received at least one shot.\\n \\nEvery day the light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter.   Tune in as I give an update on COVID-19 vaccinations.    Over one million Americans have signed up for health insurance during our special open enrollment period. That’s a big deal.\\n \\nJoin them and head to to sign up before August 15.    democrat \n"
